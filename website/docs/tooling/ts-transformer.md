[![npm version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@formatjs/ts-transformer)](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@formatjs/ts-transformer)

Extracts string messages for translation from modules that use React Intl (similar to [`babel-plugin-react-intl`](babel-plugin.md)).

Take a look at [`compile.ts`](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/blob/master/packages/ts-transformer/compile.ts) for example in integration.
